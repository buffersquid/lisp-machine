# Lisp Machine on FPGA

## A minimal, hardware-executable Lisp evaluator built from first principles.

This project implements a tiny Lisp core as a finite state machine, targeting an FPGA (Basys 3). The goal is not to simulate Lisp — it’s to be Lisp in hardware.

### Note: The hardware portion of this project is on hold for now while I work on the emulator.
